                <h2>Why I chose this image:</h2>
                <p>I have three reasons for chosing the image above.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This assignment needs 3 forms of visual media, and the first one I wanted to use was a jpg file, as it is the most basic type of image file</li>
                    <li>I am a huge nerd, and love the Sonic franchise. From games to comics, I collect them all.<br>So in essence, I wanted an excuse to use him in an assignment!</li>
                    <li>The image that follows this one will be an image made by me based on the characters from Sonic, so I figured if I was going to use my own art, I should provide a reference!</li>
                </ul>
